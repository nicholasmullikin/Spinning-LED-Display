# Spinning-LED-Display
Spinning LED Display with a quadcopter motor

This project was originally designed for a final Computer Science project, but the year ended early. 
I finished this over the summer and upgraded the Adafruit NeoPixels to Adafruit DotStars which have a faster refresh rate helpful for POV (persistence of vision) displays
The quadcopter moter is powered by an external power supply and controlled by an arduino hooked up to a computer.
The LED strip is controlled by an Arduino Nano.

There are photos and a gif on what the LED display can do.
